            <div class="problem__heading">STATUE OF POLITICS</div>
            <div class="problem__abstract">With more than 3600 monuments and having the world's tallest statue, an unofficial race of building tallest statues or more number of statues is now reaching to its extremity. Right after the inauguration of World's Tallest Statue: "The Statue of Unity", the Maharashtra Govternment got the environment clearance for building another tallest statue of the world: Chhatrapati Shivaji statue. But the game isn't over yet now UP Govt. has released the proposal of building another and taller than Chhatrapati Shivaji statue, ‘Lord Ram Statue’.<br>
                Previously, there were other Governments too who used the focus of statues for symbolizing their work and diverting the political issues.
                ‘Mayawati's Elephant Statues in Ambedkar Memorial Park’ which was made by BSP Govt. In Lucknow and the total cost of the whole project was ₹7 Billion approximately.<br>
                ‘Buddha statue on Hussain Sagar Lake’ in Hyderabad was also built by Ibrahim Qutub for depicting his pride.
                ‘Raja Bhoj Statue on Bhopal Lake’ built by Raja Bhoj.<br>
                All these examples have one thing in common, all of these statues were made by the politicians as they must have associated the statues with their pride. So, here is the question arises; Do we really need these symbols of dignity? Would there be any other way to relate to the development of the people and the country?<br>
                Why statues have become a magnet in politics?

            <div class="problem__abstract">
                With more than 54% of the workforce still dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, agriculture in India has a far-reaching impact on poverty reduction as well as rural development. Thus, it would be more meaningful to view agriculture not as farming alone but as a holistic value change which includes farming, wholesaling, warehousing, processing and retailing. Also, the fact that an average Indian spends more than 50% of his monthly expenditure on food establishes the centrality of agriculture in the context of food security concerns.<br>
                There are numerous problems faced by the farmers in India and they are:<br>
                1:-Due to lack of availability and affordability to farmers, there is a low level of use of agricultural
                Technologies. For e.g.-SMS machines, happy weed machines.<br>
                2:-There is lack of research and development in this field leading farmers to use ancestral methods and techniques and there is no major progress neither in production nor in development.

            <div class="problem__heading">THE PERSECUTED MIGRANTS</div>
            <div class="problem__abstract">he Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016 seeking to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians, who fled Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan due to religious persecution and migrated to India before December 31, 2014. Such immigrants, who entered India before December 31, 2014, and have spent at least six years, will be protected by this Bill.<br>
                The various organizations belonging to Assamese and other indigenous communities say the Citizenship Bill if passed, will be in violation of the Assam Accord of 1985 and the NRC. In the Assam Accord which the Rajiv Gandhi government had signed with All Assam Students’ Union after six-year-long Assam Agitation against the illegal immigrants, it was committed that the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, who migrated to Assam after March 24, 1971, will be detected and deported. The NRC is being updated based on the same cut-off date.<br>
                Secondly, the Assamese and the indigenous communities fear that if the Citizenship Bill is passed, it will make lakhs of illegal immigrants genuine Indians overnight and that will be a threat to Assam’s land, language, culture etc. They say an immigrant is an immigrant and there cannot be Hindu immigrant or Muslim immigrant. They insist that the immigrants, irrespective of faith who came to Assam after March 24, 1971, should be detected and deported. They say Assam is already bearing the burden of lakhs of immigrants, all faiths, who migrated prior to March 24, 1971, and it cannot take any more burden.<br>
                This will not only dangers the heritage of Assam but it also weakens the nation's security. India's neighbouring country can take advantage of this bill and might send their spies or different terrorist organization can send their men and harm our civilian’s life.

            <div class="problem__abstract">“To make medicines available at affordable cost to all.” <br>
                There can be no dispute over the objective, the sincerity of the concerned is not beyond doubt and gives rise to so many natural questions. Affordability of medicines is a major issue determining access to medicines.<br>
                Prescription drugs are an important part of the health care system and patients rely on medicines to keep them healthy. Unfortunately, prices for prescription drugs have soared in recent years. Not only are drug manufacturers launching products with high prices, but they are also routinely raising the prices of existing drugs — even decades-old drugs — by double-digit rates.<br>
                India is said to have one of the most corrupt medical systems in the world. The situation has become so bad that patients today approach the doctor with mixed feelings – of faith and fear, of hope and hostility. A medical profession which was once a respected line of work but today is corrupted at every level, from medical education to medical practice, and in both the private and government sectors. It calls for doctors, the government and the public to act against dishonest doctors, restore the dignity of the profession and work for the benefit of society.

            <div class="problem__heading">RAFALE DEAL</div>
            <div class="problem__abstract">India in September 2016 inked a direct deal with the French government to purchase 36 new Rafale fighter jets in a 7.87 billion euro deal. India will also get the latest weapons like the Meteor and Scalp missiles as part of the contract, besides a five-year support package that assures high availability of the fighter. India will pay a 15% advance and deliveries are to start in three years. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology. The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so. In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (₹1,86,000 crores), with each aircraft costing $120 million (₹746 crores).</div>

            <div class="problem__abstract">Mental health does not only means that a person is an idiot or is mad. If a person is suffering from any type of pressure or in depression and is not able to cope with their fellow mates, it also comes under the category of mental illness.<br>
                Depression is a major problem in today’s generation. Every person is going through a lot of emotions in their life and is unable to share them with someone. All the tension is piled up in their head and leads to mental illness. People suffering from this disease often gains a feeling of suicide and even try to attempt it. Crying while alone is a basic problem. <br>
                India has been declared the most depressed country by WHO (World Health Organization). Around 6.5 percent of Indians are suffering from depression. It has been a very common problem since everyone is not able to fulfill their dreams and has to compete in this fast world.<br>
                Try not to stress so much and be happy.

            <div class="problem__abstract">Plastic products have become an integral part of our daily life, encouraging their production to cross 150 million tonnes per year globally. Government tries to stop the problem, so it creating many rules, but it’s not affected by human mentality. Every day, a gigantic amount of plastic leaks into the environment, the seas, and oceans. It stays there for a very long time, damaging nature and the ecosystems that support life on Earth. Meanwhile, plastic litter continues to accumulate in world oceans. It has been estimated that 8 million tons of plastic waste reach the ocean each year, and with no action that volume is projected to double by 2030, and double again by 2050.<br>
                At least 44 sea bird species, 9 cetacean species, 11 pinniped species, 6 turtle species, and 31 invertebrate species have been documented to suffer entanglement in larger pieces of plastic debris (NOAA, 2014).<br>
                Plastic pollution poses an increasing issue for marine life. Physical harm from plastic items, Chemical harm from toxic chemicals associated with plastic (additives, persistent organic pollutants), Biological harm from microorganisms that adhere to plastics. Plastic is just one type of floating substrate in the ocean, but it is unique in a number of ways that make it particularly worrisome.

            <div class="problem__abstract">The accumulation of huge non-performing assets in banks has assumed great importance. The depth of the problem of bad debts was first realized only in the early 1990s. The magnitude of NPAs in banks and financial institutions is over Rs.1,50,000 crores. While gross NPA reflects the quality of the loans made by banks, net NPA shows the actual burden of banks. During the last quarter i.e Q2 2017-18, the bad loans of PSBs have remained almost flat at Rs.7.33 crores vis-a-vis Q1 June 17 whereas those of 17 private sector banks increased by nearly 10.5 percent to Rs. 1.06 lakh crores. This raises a concern in the industry and academia because it is generally felt that NPAs reduce the profitability of a bank, weaken its financial health and erode its solvency.</div>

            <div class="problem__abstract">The scale of the skilling challenge that India faces, and the urgency involved, have been palpable for some time, but new official data put into cold numbers the extent of the problem. Fewer than one in 10 adult Indians has had any form of vocational training, and even among those who have, the type of training is not the sort of formal skilling that employers seek – the majority had either acquired a hereditary skill or learned on the job. Just 2.2 percent of all had received formal vocational training. In comparison, 75 percent of the workforce in Germany and 80 percent in Japan has received formal skills training. Even among the BRICS countries, India lags behind – nearly half the Chinese workforce, for example, is skilled. Very few Indians get a technical education in medicine, engineering or agriculture; fewer than one in ten Indians is a graduate, and among those who are graduates, the majority get undergraduate degrees in arts, science or commerce. The problem is more acute in rural areas and for women. Without access to affordable and appropriate skills training, young people, particularly those leaving rural areas and small towns for big cities, will be stuck in low-wage, insecure jobs that will leave them in want or poverty.</div>

            <div class="problem__abstract">Media in any democratic nation plays a very important role in carrying the politics from the govt. to the nation especially in India, but it’s not hidden that many times it was media itself which was sold out to the big names or politicians. Telecasting biased news reports and hugely influencing the people of our country, this could be the worst thing a nation can face. It was not the personal willingness of an individual which allows them to sell their work but the company which they work for guides or force the individuals to do so. There is a certain list of the names out of the news reports who resigned from their respective news channels because they were forced by the company and of course the big names, to telecast biased news on prime time of the days to influence the people. Many times we must have watched the news and realized that either the reports somewhere missing some facts or they are bluffing or they are biased. Now, people changing their source of news and accepting the news being delivered by independent news reports. Hence, this gives rise to Independent Media.</div>
